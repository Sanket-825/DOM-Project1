# Practicing DOM Manipulation with a Friendly Doggo!
# DOM-Project1

I'm excited to share a small project I recently built to practice DOM manipulation in JavaScript! This project features a cute dog image and a button that toggles between "Add Friend" and "Remove Friend" functionality.

When you click the button, the text below the image changes from "Stranger" to "Friends" (and vice versa), along with a color change to green or red for visual feedback.

This project helped me solidify my understanding of how to select and modify HTML elements using JavaScript. It's a great way to learn the fundamentals of DOM manipulation, which is essential for building interactive web pages.

Here's a breakdown of the key aspects:

# DOM Selection: I used document.querySelector to target specific HTML elements like the button and the status text.
# Event Listeners: I implemented an event listener on the button to detect clicks and trigger the corresponding actions.
# DOM Manipulation: The click event handler modifies the content and style of the status text to reflect the friend status.
